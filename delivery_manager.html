           <span>Could you tell me about your current career: what is it you do now? What does a typical day look like for you? 
            How does your work involve technology, digital and data?</span>
            <p>I have a stand-up meeting with the team every morning to discuss what we've completed, what we're currently working on and any issues that are blocking the work. 
              I act as a facilitator to help the team unblock issues, plan the work ahead with the product owner and also report back up to senior management on progress. I have 
              a technical background as I was a Microsoft SQL server developer for over 15 years working with data and moved into a software Engineering post developing large 
              scale website for 4 years before becoming a Delivery Manager.</p>

                    Have any of your previous roles involved technology, digital and data, including outside the civil service? 
                    If so can you give me a bit of information about what they were and what was involved please.</span>
                    <p>I also run my own business and created and manage my own website as well as using social media to advertise my company.</p>

              <span>Why did you choose a career in technology?
              </span>
              <p>I've always been interested in IT and in particular automating manual processes to help speed up the teams work. We didn't have computers 
                in school until we were in Secondary School, but did have a computer at home that I used to code simple programme in from computing magazines.</p>

             <span>If you had to give advice to students deciding whether to choose a career in technology, what would you say to them?</span>
             <p>There's a vast amount of jobs in this area, but you need a good understanding of Maths to help you along the way. In a world where there's AI, it's a fascinating subject to get 
              into as it's all about data and using it to improve our lives. It's a subject that is rewarding, not only financially, but in helping society and businesses with like minded people.</p>

              <p>Have you seen the film 'Hidden Figures' - the extraordinary lives of four African American women who helped NASA put the first men in space using their maths backgrounds. Worth a watch!</p>
