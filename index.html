                <p>Cosy blankets, sweaters and wooly socks are all you need. Lighting some candles will make you feel even
                  more cosy. You decide what makes you feel good! Remember, it's not about going to Ikea to get the candle,
                  but appreciating the twinkly light and being mindful is what counts. It's about feeling content in a safe
                  place, whilst it's raining outside, rather than feeling blue because it's raining.</p>
