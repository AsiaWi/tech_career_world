           <span>Could you tell me about your current career: what is it you do now? What does a typical day look like for you? 
            How does your work involve technology, digital and data?</span>
            <p>I’m a software developer which means that I write the code that makes up the software product I’m working on. On a typical day 
              I’ll spend a lot of time thinking about what I need to make the software product do and decide on the best way to do it. There’s 
              never one solution to a problem and I try to work out what will be the easiest way to solve it. If I get stuck on anything or can’t decide 
              how best to do something I can always go and ask my
               colleagues and I can help them solve their problems too. We work together, breaking down 
               big problems into smaller ones that feel manageable. Before my code gets added to the software product, another developer checks it for me to make 
               sure that it’s good enough and doesn’t
                have any mistakes in it! I work in a bigger team with business analysts, user interaction designers and software testers to
               figure out what we need the software to do and what are the most important features to add.</p>

                    Have any of your previous roles involved technology, digital and data, including outside the civil service? 
                    If so can you give me a bit of information about what they were and what was involved please.</span>
                    <p>I’ve always been a software developer but not always in the civil service. I’ve written software that removes noise from sound recordings, 
                      software that can find buildings in photos taken from aeroplanes, software that printed tickets for British Airways flights, 
                      software that helped scientists do medical research, and now I work on a website for the Department of Education that shows the exam 
                      results and other information for all the schools in England.</p>

              <span>Why did you choose a career in technology?
              </span>
              <p>It was the thing I was best at. But also computer programming is like solving puzzles so it’s good fun. You have to keep learning new 
                things all the time, especially when you move jobs and start working on a completely different kind of thing.</p>

             <span>If you had to give advice to students deciding whether to choose a career in technology, what would you say to them?</span>
             <p>There are loads of careers in technology to suit you whatever your skill set and interests are. Technology is used in every business and every 
              home so you have the chance to work on such a variety of things.</p>

                Have you done any kinds of technical qualification e.g. GCSEs, a degree, an apprenticeship, etc? Would you recommend them and why?
             </span>
             <p>I did A levels in Maths, Physics and Music and a university degree in electronics and music. I did some computer programming in my electronics degree. 
              Having an electronics degree was really useful early in my career because it had taught me everything I needed to know about digitally-recorded 
              sound and that helped me in my first job, writing code that could remove noise from sound recordings.</p>
