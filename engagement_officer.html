           <span>Could you tell me about your current career: what is it you do now? What does a typical day look like for you? 
            How does your work involve technology, digital and data?</span>
            <p>I am currently an Engagement Officer in Capital DDT, although not a directly technical role, I would be considered DDT support staff. 
              In my role I design and develop training and promotional material for new systems that have been created by my team, run research sessions 
              to determine user experience and inform further development, assist with governance and business cases for new projects and ensure various 
              stakeholders are informed and involved as projects progress.</p>

                    <p>I came from a background in marketing for a private company, this involved data analysis and reporting, development of a website, 
                      managing Google & social media ads and creative digital design work.</p>

             <p>Don't be scared of the word technology, it's easy to instantly think of coding and building computers (which is is fantastic if that's 
              what you're interested in!), but technology touches our lives hundreds of times a day: in apps that allow us to learn a new language, machines 
              that help doctors diagnose and treat illnesses, even just paying for things in a shop with your phone. Technology supports us all in living our 
              day to day lives.</p>

              <p>Karen Sparck Jones - computer scientist who created the some of the first language processing models that are used today in search engines 
                like Google. Without her work, we wouldn't have such easy access to information which helps us learn do more every day! Also (general inspiration), 
                Katherine G Johnson, Mary W Jackson & Dorothy Vaughan, the 3 women working at NASA who worked on the Apollo 11 moon landing mission - watch the 
                film Hidden Figures!</p>

                Have you done any kinds of technical qualification e.g. GCSEs, a degree, an apprenticeship, etc? Would you recommend them and why?
             </span>
             <p>A-levels: Business, Media & Psychology Bachelors degree: Marketing Communications & Advertising Although I enjoyed going to university, 
              I feel that apprenticeships are a much better option now, when I left uni, I had the knowledge, but much of my skills development came afterwards 
              on the job. I think that apprenticeships give you the best of both worlds - you can get a head start and earn money at the same time!</p>
