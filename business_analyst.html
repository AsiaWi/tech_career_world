           <span>Could you tell me about your current career: what is it you do now? What does a typical day look like for you? 
            How does your work involve technology, digital and data?</span>
            <p>Day to day, I work on data/digital product development projects to investigate and understand business needs,
               current business architecture, strategies and target models to help shape the future strategic models for the business 
               area in which the new product will sit. This involves lots of stakeholder engagements, analysis of models/documents, running 
               workshops, producing business models, working with technical colleagues to draw up options, working with User Researchers to 
               understand user needs, advising seniors and making recommendations.</p>

                    Have any of your previous roles involved technology, digital and data, including outside the civil service? 
                    If so can you give me a bit of information about what they were and what was involved please.</span>
                    <p>I have worked in the civil service for over 12 years in various departments in operational delivery and policy roles. Recently 
                      I moved to a more technical role working as a Senior Business Analyst.</p>

             <span>If you had to give advice to students deciding whether to choose a career in technology, what would you say to them?</span>
             <p>You don't need to make any decisions now about your career, go try lots of different things and think about what bits you enjoy, 
              then explore the routes available to do the things you enjoy. Find ways to keep learning after you leave education, some things you 
              will enjoy, some you won't, they are all clues to help direct you forward. No matter what career you choose, the skills that will help 
              you the most and lead you to success are communicating well, taking the time to understand people, being brave and curious to try new things.</p>

                Have you done any kinds of technical qualification e.g. GCSEs, a degree, an apprenticeship, etc? Would you recommend them and why?
             </span>
             <p>I have a BSc Combined STEM which was focused on Science rather than being technical. I didn't require any qualifications for any of the roles I've done in the
               civil service including my current role. I have obtained and am working towards some professional qualifications for my current role.</p>
