           <span>Could you tell me about your current career: what is it you do now? What does a typical day look like for you?

            <p>I currently work as an Interaction Designer. A typical day as an interaction designer is creating different wireframes, 
              prototypes and documentation that help the team understand user needs and requirements. I do this by using a range of tools such as 
              graphics designers like figma or coding based designers like the Gov toolkit.</p>

                    Have any of your previous roles involved technology, digital and data, including outside the civil service?

                    <p>I attended university and during that time I worked in retail. As much as this didn't involve technology as I use it now, I used data throughout. I focused on merchandising and pushed to get trained on it. I then used sales data to create displays and arrange products. This pushed company sales, it was only a matter of time before I entered the UX umbrella! After my many years in retail, I moved into more technology focused roles. I was a Application Support Developer which focused on Software Development. I discovered I didn't like coding quite generally, especially back-end. Focusing on how databases were setup and where data existed didn't mesh well with my brain. Throughout this role I got a taste of Interaction Design and tried to focus on it, but was unsuccessful. I applied for a few Civil Service roles and was unsuccessful, before getting offered a role in the NHS. This was again more focused on Software development, but more front-end. During the interview process they noticed my passion for design so I was able to specialise more in Interaction Design. After that role I moved into Department for Education, where I am now!</p>

             </span>
             <p>I did a BSc at university called Web Technologies. I would recommend this course as it gave me a chance to explore coding and design, it gave me a chance to figiure out what I enjoyed doing and could see myself doing in the future. I loved university and if you enjoy learning I would defintely recommend going.</p>

            <p>I am an Interaction Designer for data projects. Interaction design is designing how users and products (systems, forms, etc.) interact. For me, there is no typical day! I can spend a lot of my time prototyping with a design system provided to me (I don't do much design itself). I can host workshops, conduct audits, look at analytical metrics, to name a few. The amount I can do make the role so exciting. I love switching tasks as often as I need to as I have to be very flexible to adapt to whatever project I'm working on. I work with User Researchers, Content Designers and sometimes Service Designers - we all sit under the User Experience (UX) umbrella. I work with technology and data a lot. I will use qualitative data from surveys or interviews to inform my designs and mapping. I use quantitative data from testing and analytics to do the same! I can prototype using basic HTML and CSS, or I can use different drag and drop tools to produce my work. The role itself is super flexible.</p>

              </span>
              <p>Initially, it felt like it was the next step from my university degree. I had no strong feelings towards a technology career until I found User Experience design. Since finding that, I've been comfortable in my role and pleased I've chose it. Technology felt like an area that would challenge me and help me grow, and I would say it's lived up to that experience.</p>

             <p>I would encourage it, and encourage you to keep researching the area. Technology changes all the time and roles develop and progress, and there are countless roles. I wasn't aware of any Technology Design roles until I stumbled across them at university. Also remember that it's possible to change roles and you don't have to stay in one forever. It's very common in my area that people switch roles, which is very useful to know.</p>

              </span>
              <p>There is a charity that's always inspired me called SpecialEffect. It's a gaming charity that supports physically disabled people access games. Accessibility is a big part of my job and having an organisation that supports something we can take for granted is huge for me. For specific people it would be women that I have met through my projects and work. Seeing people work day to day to advocate for accessibility, or simply good design is inspiring and motivating.</p>

             </span>
             <p>I completed my GCSEs, completed 4 AS Levels and 3 A Levels. In school we weren't offered Computer Science so I only did ICT as a data focused qualification. Where I'm from it is standard to move into A Levels if you get the GCSE grades that make it possible. From this, I then attended Newcastle University to do Computer Science. I didn't have any specific plans for university courses. I looked at Psychology, Criminology and Computer Science. My ICT teacher suggested I did Computer Science as I was good at Mathematics and ICT, which was my main driver. The university experience was very suited to me. I was moving country, so it was great to have groups of people in the same boat as I was. I struggled with the course itself until I was able to study more design related topics. I would recommend the experience, but for a career in technology it is definitely not essential.
