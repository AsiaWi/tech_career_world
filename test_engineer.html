            <p> I am currently testing a front end site for users to see information about schools in England. - A typical day would start with admin and meetings, 
              followed by looking in the list of work to see what needs testing next. After I test it I tell a developer if I have found any problems (these are called bugs)
               but if it's all OK I let the Product Owner know so that they can have a final look to check it's working as they expected.</p>

            <p>As a Senior Test Engineer, my role involves developing and implementing cost-effective methods for testing and troubleshooting computer systems and equipment. 
              Let’s delve into the specifics: Responsibilities: Test Planning: I create comprehensive test plans, ensuring they align with program requirements. 
              Complex System Testing: I assist junior engineers in conducting testing activities on intricate systems. Predictability and Improvement: My expertise contributes 
              to predictability, manufacturing processes, and equipment/process enhancement. Proposal Inputs and Reviews: I develop proposal inputs and review documents 
              generated by junior engineers. A typical day for me: Meetings: I attend meetings (approximately 2 to 3 hours) related to project updates, requirements, and progress. 
              Most of my productive time involves testing, automation, or debugging and working with development teams to identify and resolve issues.</p>

              </span>
              <p> I chose a career in technology for several reasons: Passion for Problem-Solving: Technology challenges me to solve complex problems. I thrive on finding 
                innovative solutions and improving systems. Continuous Learning: The tech field evolves rapidly, and I love learning new skills. Whether it’s mastering a 
                programming language or understanding emerging trends, I find growth exciting. Impact: Technology has a profound impact on society. Being part of this 
                transformative force motivates me. For instance, as a test engineer, I contribute to reliable software that enhances people’s lives. Collaboration: Tech 
                roles involve teamwork. I enjoy collaborating with diverse professionals—developers, designers, and project managers—to create something greater than the 
                sum of its parts. Creativity: Technology allows me to express creativity. Whether it’s designing elegant code or optimizing processes, I find joy in creating elegant solutions.</p>

          <p>I am a data test engineer. A typical day for me involves looking at data we receive about the performance of schools in primary, 
            secondary and 16 to 18 tests. We get the data in an excel spreadsheet. I then review it to check that the values given are what 
            we expect them to be. If they are then I work with the developer on our team to get the data put in a database called cosmos. I 
            use Structured Query Language (SQL) to query the data. This database is then used to populate the data that you can see on compare 
            school and college performance website. When I am not checking data, I am working with the rest of the team to understand changes we
             need to make to the site. This involves working with a business analyst and the people who drive the change to agree what should happen in our work.</p>

            <span>Why did you choose a career in technology?
            </span>
            <p>I didn't start out thinking I would end up in a career in technology. I studied english and history at university. 
              I started working for a debt charity who help people to solve their debt problems through budgeting and debt advice.
               As I stayed there longer I became a subject matter expert. This then meant that I started to become involved in user 
               acceptance testing. This is where as a user I would look at what had been changed to see if this worked. I got really involved 
               in this and this led to me becoming a test analyst! My enthusiasm for problem solving, analysis and wanting to provide a 
               great service is the main driver for how I got into a career in technology and why I stay. The positive impact you can 
               make in people's lives through tech is a great part of the role I do.</p>
