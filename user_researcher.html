           <span>Could you tell me about your current career: what is it you do now? What does a typical day look like for you? 
            How does your work involve technology, digital and data?</span>
            <p>I'm a lead user researcher working within Digital Delivery. 
              A typical day for me involves supporting my team of 18 user researchers to conduct high quality and valuable user 
              research on the digital services that they are working on. User research is a specialism which is concerned with understanding 
              the behaviour of people when they have a need (or set of needs) to use a service. In our case at the Department for Education (DfE) 
              the people that need to use our services are usually School or college leaders or teachers. We conduct research to understand what they 
              need from the DfE and then develop digital services to meet these needs - continually conducting research throughout the design and
               development to make sure what is built is fit for purpose and meets the needs of our users.</p>

                    Have any of your previous roles involved technology, digital and data, including outside the civil service? 
                    If so can you give me a bit of information about what they were and what was involved please.</span>
                    <p>after graduating from university I up-skilled myself in Digital by taking various short courses including; social media 
                      marketing and Python coding. I also read a lot of books, self taught myself to write cascading style sheets in HTML and how 
                      to use various content management systems for websites like WordPress and WiX. This enabled me to get an entry level job at a 
                      small local digital agency as an Account manager and user experience. specialist. The role required me to act as a liaison 
                      between the clients and the developers as well as populate content on client websites.</p>

              <span>Why did you choose a career in technology?
              </span>
              <p>I was unsure which direction to take my passion for research in but I had a side interest in Digital innovation. In particular the 
                advancements in Augmented Reality and their application to the medical field - surgeons seeing patient stats whilst operating without 
                looking up, training new Doctors etc. When I learnt of user-centred design research I realised I could bring together my passion for 
                research and interest in digital advancements together.</p>

             <span>If you had to give advice to students deciding whether to choose a career in technology, what would you say to them?</span>
            <p>Have a go! There's so much variety in the roles available and you can always apply what you learn in one role to another if you choose to transition. 
              Try your hand at coding a website or do a short intro to psychology course. You can read up on the different roles to see what might suit you - 
              we have a great resource for looking at the different Digital roles within Gov on gov.uk. Also, I have always found Digital 
              teams to be friendly and supportive.</p>

                Have you done any kinds of technical qualification e.g. GCSEs, a degree, an apprenticeship, etc? Would you recommend them and why?
             </span>
             <p>My qualifications are a BsC in Neuropsychology and an MSc in Investigative Psychology. Whilst these aren't 'technical' they provided me with the 
              required training in human psychology, research methods and analysis. I thoroughly enjoyed these courses and would recommend Psychology to anyone 
              interested in going into a career within user centred design.</p>
